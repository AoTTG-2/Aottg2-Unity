This plugin helps you display a runtime scene gizmo as a UI element in your Unity projects. An event is raised when a component of the gizmo is clicked.

## INSTALLATION

There are 5 ways to install this plugin:

- import [RuntimeSceneGizmo.unitypackage](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityRuntimeSceneGizmo/releases) via *Assets-Import Package*
- clone/[download](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityRuntimeSceneGizmo/archive/master.zip) this repository and move the *Plugins* folder to your Unity project's *Assets* folder
- import it from [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/runtime-scene-gizmo-123040)
- *(via Package Manager)* add the following line to *Packages/manifest.json*:
  - `"com.yasirkula.runtimescenegizmo": "https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityRuntimeSceneGizmo.git",`
- *(via [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com))* after installing [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli), run the following command:
  - `openupm add com.yasirkula.runtimescenegizmo`

## HOW TO

Simply add **Plugins/RuntimeSceneGizmo/Prefabs/GizmoRenderer** to your UI canvas and position it as you like. Gizmo will always have 1:1 aspect ratio and, by default, will be placed at the top-right corner of *GizmoRenderer*. You can change the **RenderTarget** child object's pivot for a different placement.

To invoke a function when a gizmo component is clicked, use the **On Component Clicked** event of the *GizmoRenderer* object. Functions registered to this event should ideally take a **GizmoComponent** parameter (which is defined in **RuntimeSceneGizmo** namespace).

Gizmo's rotation will match the main camera's rotation but it is possible to change the reference object via *GizmoRenderer*'s **Reference Transform** property.

GizmoRenderer will automatically create an instance of **SceneGizmo** prefab in your scene. SceneGizmo uses a camera to render the gizmo to a *RenderTexture*, which is then used by the GizmoRenderer to display the gizmo on the canvas. By default, SceneGizmo objects use layer 24 but this can be adjusted via *SceneGizmoController.GIZMOS_LAYER* constant.

See **Plugins/RuntimeSceneGizmo/Demo/DemoScene** for an example scene.
