# AutoLOD

A demo scene is available in the Demo folder. All the demo materials were created using the built-in render pipeline, but are all compatible with the material upgrade provided by unity when you click on `Edit->Rendering->Materials->Convert selected built-in materials to <URP or HDRP>`.

Have fun!
